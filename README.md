Discussion
I used Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

This todo-list app is implemented with Ruby on Rails combined with some Javascript. For authentication the gem Devise is used. Users can create projects and tasks that are associated with the projects. For projects and tasks all CRUD-actions are available. There are different options for viewing the tasks: tasks for a certain project, only tasks that are due today or tasks that are due in the next seven days. Overdue tasks are highlighted. Completed tasks can optionally be shown, too. The app is fully responsive and can be viewed on screens of all sizes. To log in you can create a personal account or use these data: username: user1@test.com, password: foobar.

A live version can be found at https://task-master22.herokuapp.com

Requirements
Ruby on Rails (for running the app locally), browser
