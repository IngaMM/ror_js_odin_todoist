Discussion
I used Ruby on Rails (backend), HTML, CSS, Javascript (frontend).

This is a basic variant of the app TodoIst (https://todoist.com). Responsiveness with media queries is included. Authentication is done with the gem devise.

A live version can be found at https://still-fjord-57301.herokuapp.com

Requirements
Ruby on Rails (for running the app locally), browser
